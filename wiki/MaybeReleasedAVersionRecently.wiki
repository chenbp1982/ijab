#iJab is under heavey developing to support other features.

   iJab is under heavey developing to support other features.Maybe we would relased a version 0.1.5 or 0.2.0 that support roster managements and some bug fix recently.After that we would focus on MUC and new user registration and tab-style chat window features.

Thanks all the people interesting with iJab.We need any advice from you.
